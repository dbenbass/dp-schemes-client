Dp-Schemes is to create an archived list of ''schemes'' for the Dirt Palace art collective.

As an institution that has been around for 18 years, I wanted to create a live digital
archive of some of the creative ideas that collective members are constantly generating. A dynamic and updatable list, members can submit ''schemes''. The result is a fun to look at and searchable ''endless scroll' that not only preserves ideas for current collective members, but also archives the mood, dynamic, and history of the people living and working in the space.

User Stories

- As a user, I can create an account and log into the site.
- I can change my password and sign out.
- I can enter a ''scheme'' with a category selected and date.
- I can add collaborators to the scheme.
- I can update scheme with additional thoughts or mark them for importance.
- As a user, I can scroll through the entire archive of "schemes", but I can also
eliminate some of the list based on search parameters such as ID number.

Future plans

- Because it is intended to be an archive, I want to discourage the user from deleting entries, but if they
choose to, the deleted entry is replaced with a ''deletion'' item.
- Set up a search function so that people can search by scheme categories based on event ideas, work day plans, "wingnut ideas", etcetera
- Make it so that only certain categories, and only certain names can be entered -- perhaps via checkboxes.
- Improve layout and design. Although I wish for it to remain relatively simple, there is definitely still some work to be done on this end.
